# GradeBook
Week 4 Gateway Final JS Project

App features:

- add assignments to the page dynamically

- remove assignments from the page dynamically

- add new students to your roster

- adding a student also properly formats their first and last name in the roster dropdown

- adding a student generates a student profile that will display when that student is selected

- adding a student generates a username for the student consisting of their first inital and last name

- the assignments form will only submit if you have a student selected

- if you do not have a student selected the app will alert you to select a student 

- assignments are students specific

- if you add an assignment to the table it also stores it to the data structure of the student that is currently selected

- the table will repopulate data dynamically based on which student is currently selected

- this flexibility allows you to add multiple students to the roster and their data will save independently

- since data saves independently you can add multiple assignments to multiple students simultaneiously and all student data is preserved when switching between student profiles. This persists until you refresh the browser

- each students gpa will calculate dynamically based on how many assignments you have added to their profile

- gpa also adjusts when you remove assignments
